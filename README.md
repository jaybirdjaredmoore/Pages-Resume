Philosophy:
I'll be the first to admit that I'm not really utilizing Jekyll to it's fullest. A static site like this seems almost antithetical to the template format that it's built for. But this has been a nice experiment, and it's a good library to keep in mind for quickly getting a blog up and running.

It has also been nice to learn more about responsive web design. Flexbox and Grid are fantastic technologies that take out a lot of the headache and "magic numbering" in maintaining a layout that might be seen across variable screen sizes.

Improvements:
There's a lot that could still be added to make the pages more responsive. I'm not clamping anything, adapting the layout at specific window thresholds, and still using specific pixel values in (probably) too many places. That's a compromise I'm willing to make though in order to get the MPV out the door, especially for aspects that can be improved upon later.
