Ideas:
- scrolling timeline
- additional text on hover
- auto opening description of categories
- animation effect for the logo? wind traveling over the top of the J? feathers coming off of it?
- section for github projects?
- breaking up the jobs into eras?
- have the menu collapse into the J logo while navigating?
- blurred background?

- bottom nav?

Index is "at a glance" with each section clickable to go into the subpages. On hover each section with jostle to show that it's clickable.
